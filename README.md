# Predicting-the-GPA
# ðŸ“š Shahzaib_Assignment_Project_3

This project focuses on predicting students' GPA based on their academic performance data using multiple regression algorithms in Python.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To build and evaluate machine learning models that can predict a student's GPA using input features such as study hours, attendance rate, extra-curricular activities, and previous grades.

---

## ðŸ§  Algorithms Used

The following regression models were applied:

- ðŸ”¹ Linear Regression
- ðŸ”¹ Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
- ðŸ”¹ Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- ðŸ”¹ Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP Regressor)
- ðŸ”¹ Decision Tree Regressor

---

## ðŸ§¼ Preprocessing Steps

- Handled missing values (if any)
- Encoded categorical variables (Gender, ExtraActivities)
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Train-test split (80% training / 20% testing)

---

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics

Each model was evaluated using the following error metrics:

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**  
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**  
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**

> ðŸ“‰ Models with the **lowest RMSE** were considered the most accurate.

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations

- Correlation Heatmap of all features
- Distribution plot of GPA
- Bar chart comparing performance (MAE, MSE, RMSE) across all models
